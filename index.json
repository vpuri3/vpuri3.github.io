[{"content":" My unsolicited two cents Writing Proofs Part of writing proofs in mathematics is convincing yourself of the reality of the statement, say P. That given the nature of reality, P is the only way things can go, and no other way is feasible.\nA way to convince yourself is to \u0026ldquo;stare at it until you believe it is true.\u0026rdquo; The methods sounds passive but in reality is fairly involved. While staring, I run thought experiments in my head imagining all sorts of test functions, sets, and what not \u0026ndash; and wonder how they interact with with the statement P. Over time the visualizations of P in your head become intricate and you become more comfortable with the idea. The aim is to get an exhaustive idea of the nature of P and be able to say with confidence \u0026ldquo;how could it be anything but P!\u0026rdquo;\nNow that the act of self delusion is over, the next (harder) step is to attack your supposition from every angle to see how much of it is true.\nWhy math is interesting The foundation of my interest in math was laid in my freshman year when I was appointed course staff to a sophomore engineering course. As I taught students to model mechanical interactions using forces and moments, I learned not only to communicate my ideas to newcomers in engineering but also how to challenge my own preconceived notions. Explaining why a certain unseen force has to exist to maintain equilibrium is like talking in a different language, in the sense that certain things are obvious (evident enough not to require proving) to me but not to a student. I have to explain that concentrated point forces, reaction moments and all these unseen entities are fictitious objects made by engineers and scientists to model and approximate reality.\nI could relate to students as I was in the same situation mere months ago, asking the same questions in disbelief. However, as I rolled concepts around in my head and thought things over I realized that however obscure, these seemingly unreal objects actually exist and their approximations are appropriate. In fact, their presence makes perfect physical sense. This epiphany, a shining moment of clarity is a reward in itself – one that makes you not want to stop thinking. Such daunting thought exercises attract me further towards the theoretical nature of engineering. It is truly marvelous to me that this edifice of human knowledge is derived from, and can be parsed through with, logical deductions based on a combination of observations and axiomatic thinking.\nIn teaching foundational topics, including proving the validity of the variational principles of mechanics, I articulated my own learning style. While studying discretization techniques in numerics courses, I became interested in the underlying variational formulation and the analytical treatment of PDEs. I studied Sobolev spaces, and wrote my own set of reference notes on the topic. I enjoyed the analytical rigor and saw a second degree in mathematics as means to place my engineering education in context within applied mathematics.\nDeep learning, composition, gradient flows In my work at Carnegie Mellon University, we have been able to recover finite element function spaces using hand-crafted neural network architectures, implying that the space of functions that can be represented by neural networks encompasses the space of finite elements. The integration of gradient flows through differentiable programming therefore allow us to attack high dimensional problems nested within engineering workflows such as automated meshing, a significant bottleneck in engineering workflows.\nDeep learning derives its powers from the composition of nonlienar operations, a setup in which model parameters can be tuned via gradient descent. It\u0026rsquo;s an interesting problem: integrating gradient flows in state of the art computational technology integrations of gradient flows (good for high dimensional problems) with state of the art simulation technology (good for 2D/3D).\nNeed to understand (Barron space ideas) what function space outputs of neural networks lie in, and what are appropriate norms for analysis in these spaces. How to manipulate them to get a desired output? how to effectively do regression?\nOur job as computational engineers Computational workflows form a tall stack of abstractions that map physical quantities like velocity to distributed data structures acted upon by numerical operators. Scientific computing consolidates my interest in physics and the intricate mathematical framework that attempts to explain it. As such, developing mathematical models to accurately capture physics is a creative problem I like spending time on.\nPresent challenges in predictive modelling vary with the level of analysis applied from robust meshing of complex geometries to reliable turbulence models. With the aim of optimizing Computer Aided Engineering workflows, my focus is on developing application-specific tools for problems that advance humanity\u0026rsquo;s technological prowess.\nDifferentiable programming offer a superior way of integrating data with theory. Our job is to develop the tools that further our understanding the most. Aim is to develop problem specific architectures for PDE solving in complex geometries. The task is to develop a hybrid (sort) system where we can utilizes gradient flows (DL) and high order function approximation (FEM type) in an efficient way.\nMisc (do not read) This seems to be the nature of the universe: no matter how far you zoom in, you can still zoom in more. we\u0026rsquo;re just limited by our abilities not but a lack of detail to discover. no matter how far you zoom out, you can zoom out more. there\u0026rsquo;s always more stuff to look at. let\u0026rsquo;s call the un-computable transcendental. now by virtue of its infiniteness and by virtue of the the finiteness of human abilities of logic and to reason, the relationship one has with the nature of the universe has to be private because nobody can articulate it completely and explain it to themselves or to others. it\u0026rsquo;s like an infinitely layered story. something you can go on and on about without getting to the bottom of it. like a great book. or a great story. it\u0026rsquo;s by definition that the transcendent cannot be reduced a single or any number of thoughts or ideas or things without it automatically losing its essence. Ok I should get back to work.\nTet meshes Tetrehedral meshes are everywhere. Geometry is designed with splines and immidiately translated and shared with tet meshes. Splines rule CAD because knots give a designer granular control over the shape of their part.\nI\u0026rsquo;m very curious about implicit geometry representations, particularly high order spectral representations (neural too because that\u0026rsquo;s just a different basis to same difference) because it provides a bigger bang for your buck: you can accurately represent a more complicated function with the same number of points with chebychev distribution rather than uniform distribution (Runge phenomena). The issue with spectral geometry processing might be with patching, ie how to make different spectral pieces talk to each other. In Spectral Element Method, C0 continuity is handled via a gather-scatter operation, meaning that the adjacency matrix only needs to account for the boundary nodes.\nIt would be interesting to learn how splines preserve locality, and how they impose cotinuity conditions across \u0026ldquo;elements\u0026rdquo;.\n","permalink":"https://vpuri3.github.io/thoughts/","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"section-card\" \u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"my-unsolicited-two-cents\"\u003eMy unsolicited two cents\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cdiv class=\"project-card\"\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"writing-proofs\"\u003eWriting Proofs\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003cp\u003ePart of writing proofs in mathematics is convincing yourself of the reality of the statement, say P.

Check out my single page CV if you\u0026rsquo;re feeling lazy.\nBS @ University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign I attended University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign from 2015 to 2019, earning Bachelor\u0026rsquo;s degrees in Mathematics, Engineering Mechanics, and a minor in Computational Science and Engineering. While at university, I became interested in the numerical treatment of partial differential equations for physical modeling. To that effect, I made an attempt to comprehend the entire knowledge stack of computer simulations: I studied Hamiltonian mechanics to learn how physics is modeled; Sobolev spaces to learn the mathematical treatment of differential operators; and numerical algorithms for converting continuous equationsinto solvable problems.\nTo complement my classwork, I wrote spectral element codes to solve fluid-flows in interesting geometries, and interned first at the National Center for Supercomputing Applications on numerical PDEs, and then at the Argonne National Laboratory on wall-bounded turbulent flows. The work from ANL resulted in my senior thesis. I also have substantial on-campus engagement through Society for Engineering Mechanics, a student organization that I led in my senior year.\nSociety for Engineering Mechanics We engineerined mechanics. Add link to projects like chocolate 3D printer, SIIP work.\nIntroductory Statics Course Assistant At UIUC, I discovered an interest in teaching when I was selected in freshman year to be a course assistant for Introductory Statics, a mechanics course where students learn to model mechanical interactions as forces and moments. The instructors for Statics invited me to attend the Strategic Instructional Innovations Program meetings to assist with curriculum design for mechanics courses serving $2500$ students annually. I created engineering-design oriented activities for students and coordinated with the Society for Engineering Mechanics, a student organization that I led in my senior year, to manufacture instructional demonstrations for introductory courses in Statics, Dynamics, and Solid Mechanics.\nIllini Hyperloop As our capstone project at UIUC, my group implemented a passive cooling solution capable of absorbing up to 300 kJ of heat. The solution would be used for the propulsion system of the Hyperloop pod of Illini Hyperloop team participating in SpaceX Hyperloop Competition 2019. Fabrication was handled by the project sponsor, Novark Technologies, Inc. The project video, report, and summary can be found here.\nNational Center for Supercomputing Applications, 2017-18 My work at NCSA on initial data generation for gravitational wave simulations resulted in a talk that I delivered at the American Physical Society April Meeting 2018. Under Dr. Roland Haas of the Gravity Group, I solved nonlinear elliptic initial data equations for gravitational wave simulations in the cosmological framework Einstein Toolkit. I implemented the novel Scheduled Relaxation Jacobi technique which relies on precomputing a set of relaxation factors by nonlinear optimization for Laplacian-dominated PDEs. The relaxation solve was embedded within a Newton-Raphson loop to alleviate the stiffness due to nonlinearity, reducing the time-to-solution by several orders of magnitude.\nArgonne Natinoal Laboratory, 2018 In the summer of 2018, I studied wall-bounded turbulence flows at Argonne Natinoal Lab Dr. Ramesh Balakrishnan, and Dr. Aleksandr Obabko of the Mathematics and Computer Science divisio. The project was part of a larger United States Department of Energy effort on simulating airflow in open-ocean windfarms. I examined the physics of flows over curved geometries by conducting Direct Numerical Simulations.\nTo facilitate the development of wall-models for Large Eddy Simulations, I computed the terms of the tensor Reynolds Stress Transport Equation within the spectral element fluid dynamics code NEK5000. The converged Reynolds Stress budgets (third order statistics) proper resolution of the high-frequency modes in my calculation, and reveal the spatial distribution and relative magnitudes of the production, dissipation, and transport mechanisms of turbulent energy. My FORTRAN 77 routines for turbulence statistics computation and post-processing in NEK5000 can be found in this git repo.\nAs the scope of the project was too broad for one summer, I continued the work as thesis research at University of Illinois.\nArgonne Natinoal Laboratory, 2020 I returned to Argonne after graduation to continue working on turbulence modeling problems, with a focus on complex geometry, and hierarchical simulations where the output of a highly resolved but simplified calculation would be used in modelling unresolved physics in a larger more complicated simulation. I conducted Large Eddy Simulations (LES) and Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculations of airflow near building-like geometries for the DOE’s Distributed Windproject. The overarching goal of the project is to obtain high-resolution LES and DNS data to support development of subgrid-stress models and wall-models for Detached Eddy Simulations and Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes simulations.\nCarnegie Mellon University, 2020 In July 2020, I connected with Professor Venkat Viswanathan at Carnegie Mellon University, who expressed interest in developing differentiable programming models for computational fluid dynamics problems. With his group, I tackled problems in scientific computing in a very broad sense, while pushing out packages in the Julia ecosystem. In our work, we have been able to recover finite element function spaces using hand-crafted neural network architectures, implying that the space of functions that can be represented by neural networks encompasses the space of finite elements.\nAs such, the Viswanathan research group\u0026rsquo;s emphasis on pushing out open source packages and ties to commercial markets would constrain and guide my research endeavors in a fruitful direction.\nStarted work on fully differentiable spectral element solver implemented in Julia.\nJulia Computing, 2021 I am working on deploying Physics Informed Neural Networks for Julia Computing\u0026rsquo;s commercial products under Dr. Chris Rackauckas. I also wrote the linear solver interface for DifferentialEquations.jl ecosystem.\nPhD @ Carnegie Mellon University, 2022- In January 2022, I will join Carneige Mellon University to continue working on numerical PDEs with the Viswanathan Research Group in the Mechanical Engineering Department. Having worked with the group for about a year, the group\u0026rsquo;s emplasis on pushing out open source packages and ties to commercial markets constrains and guides my research endeavors in a fruitful direction.\n","permalink":"https://vpuri3.github.io/work/","summary":"\u003cdiv class=\"section-card\" \u003e\n\u003ch1 id=\"work-summary\"\u003eWork summary\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThis page is an extended curriculum viatte with unnecessary commentary.
