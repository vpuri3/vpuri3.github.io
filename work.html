<h2 id="bs--university-of-illinois-urbana-champaign">BS @ University of
Illinois Urbana-Champaign</h2>
<p>I attended University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign from 2015 to 2019,
earning Bachelor's degrees in <em>Mathematics</em>, <em>Engineering
Mechanics</em>, and a minor in <em>Computational Science and
Engineering</em>. While at university, I became interested in the
numerical treatment of partial differential equations for physical
modeling. To that effect, I made an attempt to comprehend the entire
knowledge stack of computer simulations: I studied Hamiltonian mechanics
to learn how physics is modeled; Sobolev spaces to learn the
mathematical treatment of differential operators; and numerical
algorithms for converting continuous equationsinto solvable
problems.</p>
<p>To complement my classwork, I wrote <a
href="https://github.com/vpuri3/spec">spectral element codes</a> to
solve fluid-flows in interesting geometries, and interned first at the
National Center for Supercomputing Applications on numerical PDEs, and
then at the Argonne National Laboratory on wall-bounded turbulent flows.
The work from ANL resulted in my senior thesis. I also have substantial
on-campus engagement through Society for Engineering Mechanics, a
student organization that I led in my senior year.</p>

<h3 id="introductory-statics-course-assistant"><em>Introductory
Statics</em> Course Assistant</h3>
<p>At UIUC, I discovered an interest in teaching when I was selected in
freshman year to be a course assistant for <em>Introductory
Statics</em>, a mechanics course where students learn to model
mechanical interactions as forces and moments. The instructors for
<em>Statics</em> invited me to attend the <em>Strategic Instructional
Innovations Program</em> meetings to assist with curriculum design for
mechanics courses serving <span class="math inline">2500</span> students
annually. I created engineering-design oriented activities for students
and coordinated with the Society for Engineering Mechanics, a student
organization that I led in my senior year, to manufacture instructional
demonstrations for introductory courses in <em>Statics</em>,
<em>Dynamics</em>, and <em>Solid Mechanics</em>.</p>
<h3 id="illini-hyperloop">Illini Hyperloop</h3>
<p>As our capstone project at UIUC, my group implemented a passive
cooling solution capable of absorbing up to 300 kJ of heat. The solution
would be used for the propulsion system of the Hyperloop pod of Illini
Hyperloop team participating in SpaceX Hyperloop Competition 2019.
Fabrication was handled by the project sponsor, Novark Technologies,
Inc. The project video, report, and summary can be found <a

Center for Supercomputing Applications, 2017-18</h2>
<p>My work at NCSA on initial data generation for gravitational wave
simulations resulted in a talk that I delivered at the <em>American
Physical Society April Meeting 2018</em>. Under Dr. Roland Haas of the
Gravity Group, I solved nonlinear elliptic initial data equations for
gravitational wave simulations in the cosmological framework Einstein
Toolkit. I implemented the novel Scheduled Relaxation Jacobi technique
which relies on precomputing a set of relaxation factors by nonlinear
optimization for Laplacian-dominated PDEs. The relaxation solve was
embedded within a Newton-Raphson loop to alleviate the stiffness due to
nonlinearity, reducing the time-to-solution by several orders of
magnitude.</p>
<h2 id="argonne-natinoal-laboratory-2018">Argonne Natinoal Laboratory,
2018</h2>
<p>In the summer of 2018, I studied wall-bounded turbulence flows at
Argonne Natinoal Lab Dr. Ramesh Balakrishnan, and Dr. Aleksandr Obabko
of the Mathematics and Computer Science divisio. The project was part of
a larger United States Department of Energy effort on simulating airflow
in open-ocean windfarms. I examined the physics of flows over curved
geometries by conducting Direct Numerical Simulations.</p>
<p>To facilitate the development of wall-models for Large Eddy
Simulations, I computed the terms of the tensor Reynolds Stress
Transport Equation within the spectral element fluid dynamics code
NEK5000. The converged Reynolds Stress budgets (third order statistics)
proper resolution of the high-frequency modes in my calculation, and
reveal the spatial distribution and relative magnitudes of the
production, dissipation, and transport mechanisms of turbulent energy.
My FORTRAN 77 routines for turbulence statistics computation and
post-processing in NEK5000 can be found in this <a
href="https://github.com/vpuri3/NekTools">git</a> repo.</p>
<p>As the scope of the project was too broad for one summer, I continued
the work as thesis research at University of Illinois.</p>
<h2 id="argonne-natinoal-laboratory-2020">Argonne Natinoal Laboratory,
2020</h2>
<p>I returned to Argonne after graduation to continue working on
turbulence modeling problems, with a focus on complex geometry, and
hierarchical simulations where the output of a highly resolved but
simplified calculation would be used in modelling unresolved physics in
a larger more complicated simulation. I conducted Large Eddy Simulations
(LES) and Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) calculations of airflow
near building-like geometries for the DOE’s Distributed Windproject. The
overarching goal of the project is to obtain high-resolution LES and DNS
data to support development of subgrid-stress models and wall-models for
Detached Eddy Simulations and Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes
simulations.</p>
<h2 id="carnegie-mellon-university-2020">Carnegie Mellon University,
2020</h2>
<p>In July 2020, I connected with Professor Venkat Viswanathan at
Carnegie Mellon University, who expressed interest in developing
differentiable programming models for computational fluid dynamics
problems. With his group, I tackled problems in scientific computing in
a very broad sense, while pushing out packages in the Julia ecosystem.
In our work, we have been able to recover finite element function spaces
using hand-crafted neural network architectures, implying that the space
of functions that can be represented by neural networks encompasses the
space of finite elements.</p>
<p>As such, the Viswanathan research group's emphasis on pushing out
open source packages and ties to commercial markets would constrain and
guide my research endeavors in a fruitful direction.</p>
<p>Started work on fully differentiable spectral element solver
implemented in Julia.</p>
<h2 id="julia-computing-2021">Julia Computing, 2021</h2>
<p>I am working on deploying Physics Informed Neural Networks for Julia
Computing's commercial products under Dr. Chris Rackauckas. I also wrote
the linear solver interface for <code>DifferentialEquations.jl</code>
ecosystem.</p>
<h1 id="phd--carnegie-mellon-university-2022-">PhD @ Carnegie Mellon
University, 2022-</h1>
<p>In January 2022, I will join Carneige Mellon University to continue
working on numerical PDEs with the <a
href="https://www.cmu.edu/me/venkatgroup/">Viswanathan Research
Group</a> in the Mechanical Engineering Department. Having worked with
the group for about a year, the group's emplasis on pushing out open
source packages and ties to commercial markets constrains and guides my
research endeavors in a fruitful direction.</p>
